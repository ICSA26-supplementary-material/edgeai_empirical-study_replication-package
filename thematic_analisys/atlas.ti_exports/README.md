# ATLAS.ti Exports – Documentation

This folder contains all **ATLAS.ti exports** used in our EdgeAI architecture study.  
The goal of this README is to help readers understand **what each export file contains**,  
**how it was generated**, and **how it can be reused or replicated**.

> 🧭 **How to read this document**  
> For each exported file we provide a **short, focused description**:
> - **Purpose:** why this file exists in the pipeline.
> - **Contents:** what kind of data it includes (codes, quotations, networks, etc.).
> - **Usage:** how this export is used in our analyses or replication.
