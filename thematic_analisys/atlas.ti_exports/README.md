Below we will document **each export file** individually.

For every file, we will add a mini-section in the following format:

[//]: # (```text)

### 2.1 20250914_theme_frequencies.csv

- **Purpose:**  
  This export summarizes the **frequency of all themes** identified during the ATLAS.ti coding process. It provides a quantitative view of how often each high-level theme appeared across the coded fragments.

- **Contents:**  
  A CSV table containing at least two columns:  
  - **theme** – the thematic label or category assigned during axial/thematic coding.  
  - **frequency** – the number of times that theme appeared in the dataset (i.e., total quotations coded with that theme or aggregated subcodes).  

  This export represents the **final consolidated theme frequency table** used for descriptive statistics in the study.

- **Usage:**  
  Ideal for:  
  - generating plots (bar charts, Pareto charts, heatmaps);  
  - inspecting theme distribution for RQ1.x;  
  - validating the representativeness of guideline families;  
  - triangulating with the GitHub mining dataset and ISO/IEC mappings.  

  Researchers replicating this study can recompute this table by regrouping codes → categories → themes following the same hierarchical structure documented in the coding scheme.

### 2.2 20250914_code_frequencies.csv

- **Purpose:**  
  This file provides the **frequency of each individual code** used during the ATLAS.ti open coding phase.  
  While the theme frequency export aggregates information at a higher level, this file captures the **granular coding activity**, enabling deeper quantitative inspection of the coding scheme.

- **Contents:**  
  A CSV table typically containing:  
  - **code** – the exact code label assigned to quotations during open coding.  
  - **frequency** – the number of quotations associated with each code.  

  The table includes both low-level codes and more abstract codes, depending on how the coding hierarchy was structured.

- **Usage:**  
  Useful for:  
  - analyzing which concepts were most prominent in the qualitative dataset;  
  - generating visualizations (e.g., bar charts, Zipf-like distributions, code clouds);  
  - validating the consistency of the coding process;  
  - supporting RQ1.x by quantifying architectural concerns, patterns, and EdgeAI practices extracted from repositories;  
  - triangulating with ISO/IEC 25010 quality attribute mappings and guideline families.

  This export is essential for replicating the **open coding stage** and for reconstructing the prevalence of each architectural construct identified in the study.

### 2.3 20250914_code_coocurrrence.xlsx

- **Purpose:**  
  This export contains the **code co-occurrence matrix** generated by ATLAS.ti.  
  It documents how frequently two codes appear together in the same quotation or fragment, enabling analysis of relationships, patterns, and conceptual proximity across the coded dataset.

- **Contents:**  
  An Excel file (`.xlsx`) typically containing:
  - A **matrix/table** where rows and columns represent all codes.
  - Each cell contains the **co-occurrence frequency** between the pair (row code ↔ column code).
  - Depending on the ATLAS.ti export, the file may also include:
    - normalized co-occurrence values  
    - percentage co-occurrence  
    - filters for minimum frequency  

  This dataset reflects **associations between architectural concerns** emerging from the repositories.

- **Usage:**  
  Suitable for:
  - identifying clusters of related codes;
  - discovering emerging architectural themes and guideline groups;
  - calculating similarity metrics (e.g., Jaccard, cosine similarity);
  - generating network graphs (nodes = codes; edges = co-occurrence strength);
  - triangulating with the thematic analysis to validate families, categories, and guideline structures;
  - supporting RQ1.x by revealing **which architectural concepts tend to appear together**.

  This export is particularly valuable for **data-driven theme formation** and validating the cohesion of guideline families.

### 2.4 20250914_citation_manager.csv

- **Purpose:**  
  This export contains all **quotation-level citation references** generated inside ATLAS.ti.  
  It links each coded fragment to its **original source repository**, commit, file, or documentation segment.  
  This file ensures **traceability**, allowing any researcher to verify where each fragment came from.

- **Contents:**  
  A CSV table typically including:
  - **quotation_id** – unique ID assigned by ATLAS.ti to each fragment.  
  - **source_reference / document / origin** – the file or repository from which the quotation was extracted.  
  - **metadata** – additional contextual information such as authorship, repository name, filename, or other identifiers.  
  - **links or citation strings** – used internally to track provenance from GitHub to ATLAS.ti.  

  This dataset captures **the mapping between qualitative evidence and source artifacts**, essential for reproducibility.

- **Usage:**  
  Ideal for:
  - reconstructing the provenance of each architectural fragment used in the thematic analysis;  
  - validating quotations or re-checking context during replication;  
  - cross-linking GitHub mining results with ATLAS.ti’s coded quotations;  
  - building supplementary tables that show “which repository produced which evidence”;  
  - ensuring methodological transparency required for ICSA-level empirical studies.

  It is especially important for reviewers and replicators who need to verify  
  **“Where did this fragment come from?”** for any guideline, category, or theme.

### 2.5 20250914_codebook_full.csv

- **Purpose:**  
  This file contains the **complete ATLAS.ti codebook** used in the study.  
  It documents every code created during open, axial, and thematic coding, including definitions, descriptions, and hierarchical relationships.  
  It serves as the **authoritative reference** for understanding the meaning and intent behind each code.

- **Contents:**  
  A CSV file typically including the following fields:
  - **code** – the exact name of the code.  
  - **description / definition** – a short explanation detailing what the code represents.  
  - **category / group / family** – higher-level grouping assigned to the code (if structured).  
  - **theme (if applicable)** – the theme or conceptual cluster associated with the code.  
  - **created_by / created_on** – optional metadata about authorship or session.  
  - **remarks / comments** – any additional guidance used during coding.

  This export consolidates the **semantic meaning** behind the entire coding scheme used in the EdgeAI architectural analysis.

- **Usage:**  
  Useful for:
  - ensuring semantic consistency when interpreting codes;  
  - validating alignment across multiple coders or research sessions;  
  - supporting transparency in the qualitative methodology;  
  - enabling replication of the coding process by external researchers;  
  - constructing tables for the paper’s supplementary material (e.g., guideline families, categories, definitions).  

  This file is particularly important for reviewers who want to understand **exactly how codes were defined**, and for researchers who wish to replicate or extend the thematic analysis.

### 2.6 20250914_code_coocurrrence_count.csv

- **Purpose:**  
  This file contains the **raw co-occurrence counts** between pairs of codes as exported from ATLAS.ti.  
  Unlike the `.xlsx` matrix version, this CSV provides the **long-form (tidy) representation**, listing each co-occurring pair explicitly.  
  It is essential for statistical analysis, clustering, and generating visualizations that require pairwise relationships.

- **Contents:**  
  A CSV table typically including:
  - **code_1** – the first code in the co-occurrence pair.  
  - **code_2** – the second code.  
  - **count** – how many quotations include both codes simultaneously.  
  - (Optionally) **normalized values**, depending on export settings.  

  Each row explicitly represents one pair, making the dataset ideal for computational analysis.

- **Usage:**  
  Useful for:
  - building co-occurrence **network graphs** (nodes = codes, edges = co-occurrence strength);  
  - calculating similarity metrics such as **Jaccard, cosine similarity, lift, PMI**;  
  - deriving clusters of architectural concerns (e.g., guideline families);  
  - generating heatmaps or edge-weighted adjacency matrices;  
  - validating thematic relationships found during axial coding.  

  This form is preferred for **Python/R analyses**, since it is already in a tidy structure and can be easily pivoted or fed into graph libraries (e.g., NetworkX, Gephi, iGraph).

### 2.7 20250914_code_coocurrrence_coef.csv

- **Purpose:**  
  This file captures the **co-occurrence coefficients** between pairs of codes, as calculated or exported by ATLAS.ti.  
  These coefficients express **the strength of association** between two codes beyond raw frequency counts, enabling more robust interpretations of conceptual relationships.

- **Contents:**  
  A CSV file in long-form format, typically including:
  - **code_1** – first code in the pair.  
  - **code_2** – second code in the pair.  
  - **coefficient** – the co-occurrence coefficient between the pair (e.g., C-coefficient, Jaccard-based metric, or ATLAS.ti’s internal metric).  
  - In some exports, additional fields may appear (e.g., **count**, **normalized score**, **expected co-occurrence**).

  This dataset quantifies **how strongly two codes tend to appear together** relative to their individual frequencies.

- **Usage:**  
  Useful for:
  - ranking the strongest conceptual relationships between architectural concerns;  
  - generating **weighted edge networks** for clustering (e.g., community detection using Louvain/Leiden);  
  - identifying emerging families or guideline clusters with high internal cohesion;  
  - validating themes discovered during qualitative synthesis;  
  - comparing raw co-occurrence counts vs. normalized association strengths.

  This export is especially important when investigating **which architectural concepts are genuinely related**, rather than merely co-occurring due to code prevalence.

### 2.8 20250914_co-ocurrence.csv

- **Purpose:**  
  This file provides a **summary-level co-occurrence export** generated by ATLAS.ti.  
  It usually consolidates co-occurrence information across codes, themes, or categories—depending on the export settings.  
  It serves as a compact, high-level reference complementing the more detailed co-occurrence matrices and coefficient tables.

- **Contents:**  
  A CSV containing one of the following structures (depending on how ATLAS.ti created the export):
  - **(Common case)** A list of code pairs and their co-occurrence counts.  
  - **(Alternative)** A code–theme or theme–theme co-occurrence summary.  
  Typical columns include:
    - **unit_1** – first element in the co-occurrence pair (code or category).  
    - **unit_2** – second element in the pair.  
    - **count** – number of shared quotations.  
    - Optional: **density**, **strength**, or **proximity** metrics.  

  This version tends to be more compact than the detailed `_count` or `_coef` tables.

- **Usage:**  
  Useful for:
  - quick inspection of which codes or categories tend to co-occur;  
  - generating simplified visualizations (e.g., chord diagrams, small heatmaps, top-N pairs);  
  - informing guideline grouping or architectural concern clustering;  
  - sanity-checking the larger co-occurrence datasets to ensure internal consistency;  
  - supporting descriptive statistical summaries in the replication package.

  This file is ideal for **lightweight analysis** or for readers who want a clear overview without processing the full matrices or coefficient tables.
